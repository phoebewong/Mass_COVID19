# Data as of: Apr 19, 2020

# Data
The data shown in plots comes from the archive data from [Massachusetts Department of Public Health](https://www.mass.gov/info-details/covid-19-cases-quarantine-and-monitoring). Note that DPH changed the data format since Apr 20, 2020. Therefore, some re-engineering is needed to continue the daily update.

Confirmed cases data is published daily. 

City/town level data is updated each Wednesday.

# Background
This is a R shiny dashboard, created by Phoebe Wong, a Boston-based data scientist who wants to understand and visualize the data. It is however impossible without the huge and supportive R open-source community.
